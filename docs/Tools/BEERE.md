BEERE is the abbreviation of Biomedical Entity Expansion, Ranking, and Explorations, which can help biomedical researchers investigate the relevant significance of genes, proteins, and general biomedical concepts—biomedical entities—among one another from public knowledge-base of protein/gene interactions and extracted semantic relationships. BEERE aims to assist users to quickly evaluate and prioritize a list of genes or terms, i.e., “entities”, based on our established network ranking technique (1) which can take advantage of a network of probabilistic functional relationships extracted a priori. It also provide the significance of genes in functional gene set or networks.
