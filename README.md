## Geonomic Data Science 

With genomics sparks a revolution in medical discoveries, it becomes imperative to be able to better understand the genome, and be able to leverage the data and information from genomic data-sets. Genomic Data Science is the field that applies statistics and data science to the genome.


## Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that debelops computational methods and software packages for analyzing biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines technologies from computer science, statistics, and optimization to process biological data.


## Applied Informatics, Mathematics, Engineering and Data Science 

The ai.MED laboratory, directed by Prof. Jake Chen at UAB, aims to accelerate intelligent applications of genomic data science in biomedical research, healthcare, and drug discovery through cutting-edge bioinformatics and data science research.
