## About

We describe a new biomolecular characterization and prioritization
tool called Weighted In-Network Node Expansion and Ranking (WINNER).
It takes the input of any molecular interaction network data and generates
an optionally expanded network with all the nodes ranked according to
their relevance to one another in the network. To help users assess the
robustness of results, WINNER provides two dierent types of statistics. The
first type is a node-expansion p-value, which helps evaluate the statistical
significance of adding “non-seed” molecules to the original biomolecular
interaction network consisting of “seed” molecules and molecular interactions.
The second type is a node-ranking p-value, which helps evaluate the
relative statistical significance of the contribution of each node to the
overall network architectur
